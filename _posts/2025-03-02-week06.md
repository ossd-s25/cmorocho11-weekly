title: Week 6 - Contributions Update
---

### Personal Contributions
So far, my contributions have been relatively straightforward and not at all code-intensive. I had lots of fun looking over the OpenStreetMap and iNaturalist projects and adding my own contributions to them. My favorite contribution so far has been iNaturalist because I personally love nature and being able to record and log the interesting flora and birds I see around campus has been amazing.

Contributing to OpenStreetMap was not as straightforward. I would love to contribute to areas that have little to no contributions, but I can only rely on other map applications since some areas are hard to get to. In my local neighborhood, I was able to update a store that closed down with the new coffee shop that opened in its place. In the future, I would like to complete more coding-related contributions or contributions to larger community-based projects, but itâ€™s hard to find ones that are ideal and still within my skill set.
